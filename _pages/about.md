I obtained BSc degrees in Computer Science (minor) and Chemistry (major) from Jilin University in China (2001-2005), and an MSc degree in Analytical Chemistry from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (2009-2012). Between 2005 and 2009, I worked as a Research Fellow (研究实习员) in CIAC, CAS, and subsequently was promoted to Research Associate (助理研究员). My work during this period focused on answering basic biophysical problems e.g. in the areas of protein folding, intrinsically disordered proteins, and large-scale conformational changes in folded proteins using coarse-grained models and enhanced sampling methods. In 2013 I move to Denmark to pursuit my PhD in Biology under the supervision of Kresten Lindorff-Larsen and obtained my PhD degree in Dec. of 2016. Since then I has been recruited in a long-term (five-year, BRAINSTUC) project in close collaboration with other five experimental groups in Denmark by integrating e.g. HDX-MS, NMR, SAXS, and CryoEM, with simulations/modeling. 

I am currently an assitant professor (助理教授) in the department of biology at University of Copenhagen. I will start my own group at Zhejiang University in China since June of 2021. Contact me if you are interested in working or collaborating with me.
